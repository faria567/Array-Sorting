Explanation:

1. I have used std::vector to store the numbers, and I have implemented a binary search algorithm to find the index of the target number or the position where it would be inserted.

2. I include necessary header files (iostream for input/output operations and vector for using dynamic arrays).

3. The searchInsertPosition function sorts the input array nums and then performs binary search to find the index of the target number or the position where it would be inserted.

4. In the main function, I take the number of elements in the array, the elements themselves, and the target number as input from the user.

5. I then call the searchInsertPosition function to find the output and print it.
